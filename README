Em: An Emacs-style editor in the public domain

This is a fork of the mg editor from the OpenBSD sources. It has many
features removed, mostly related to customization and specific editing
modes. It should also build portably on systems with an ANSI C
compiler.

Dave Conroy wrote the original uemacs in 1985, and the README from mg
